#fileDetect
Test project for MIME content detection
====

### Project Layout
Project is laid out as follows :
- css - for any CSS files (not a lot here since this is a test project for the development of a class library and not really anything else)
- libraries - Holds any PHP class files related to the project. 'mime.php' is the primary library in development.
- partials - contains html file partials
- root - index.php file and readme. Develop branch README will be used for notes and general thoughts throughout the project life cycle. Master README will be used, eventually, for general how-to's and stuff like that.
