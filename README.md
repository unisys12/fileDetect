fileDetect
==========

Test project to accurately detect MIME file type info. Nothing special to see here, so move along people!

### Project Structure for PHP examples
- partials - Contains HTML partials
- libraries - Contains PHP Class Files
- css - Contains CSS files... of course!

### Project Structure for JavaScript examples
- partials - Contains HTML partials
- js - Contains JS files. Takes place of libraries folder above. Could be names the same. Nameing habit
- css - Contains CSS files... still!

### Project Purpose
I have taken on the self imposed task of learning all that I can about file type detection in modern web development. This started out as helping out on another project and has led to a much longer journey to learn all that I can on this topic. I have read a ton, got very frustrated and got back on board. Learning and understanding this process has truly become a sideline passion for me.

### Repo Structure
The examples in each branch represent very basic examples of how to retrieve the MIME content info from a file using either a different language or technique, while trying to keep the initial project structure the same.

### A Little About Me
Now, bear in mind that I do not do this for a living. I simple love web development and do this as a hobby. Sure, I would love to do this for a living, but... not there yet!
